These web pages were developed by Brian White at the University of
Massachusetts, Boston. He uses them in lecture to demonstrate some
important features of hemoglobin.
</p>
<p>
The pages were originally developed using the Chime plug-in. The original
Chime implementation can be found at <br />

>http://intro.bio.umb.edu/111-112/111F98Lect/hemoglobin2/hemolect.html</a>
</p>
<p>
These pages were converted automatically from Chime to Jmol using the
<i>chime2jmol.pl</i> perl script.
</p>
<p>
The scripts are simple & must be accessed in order from top to bottom or
strange things will result. The hemoglobin files are a little large, so you may
experience a delay after a button is pressed. In addition, there are explicit
delays built into the scripts, so be patient after pressing a button.
