    <title>New Scripting Engine</title>
    <para>
      The scripting engine has been completely rewritten for Jmol Release
      6. As of this writing it should be considered *alpha test* code. Please
      supply feedback in case of bugs and/or unexpected behavior and/or
      with feature requests. You can do this through the jmol home page
      <ulink url="http://jmol.sourceforge.net">jmol.sourceforge.net</ulink>

  Jmol supports the RasMol scripting language defined by RasMol. 
  Information about RasMol can be found at 
  <ulink url="http://www.openrasmol.org/">www.openrasmol.org</ulink>
  The current URL for full RasMol documentation is:
  <ulink url="http://www.openrasmol.org/doc/rasmol.htm">

<para>
  The Chime web browser plug-in was based upon the RasMol source code.
  Various extensions were added, including additional scripting
  commands. Information about Chime can be found at
  <ulink url="http://www.mdlchime.com/">www.mdlchime.com</ulink>
  The current URL for extended chime scripting commands is:
  <ulink url="http://www.mdlchime.com/chime/chimerasmol.html">

<para>
  Jmol currently supports many of RasMol/Chime scripting commands. Our
  goal is to eventually provide full script support. This will provide
  a migration path for those who wish to move to an open source solution
  that supports a larger number of file formats on a wider variety of
  hardware platforms. 
</para>
<para>
  In this release most movement, selection, atom expression and
  color commands are operational. 
</para>
<para>
  Things that explicitly do *not* work are protein rendering formats such
  as ribbons, cartoons, strands, etc. Jmol does not perform lighting
  and surface rendering on the fly, so settings such as ambient, shadows,
  specular and specpower are not available. Finally, Jmol does not have
  a true 3D graphics engine, so renderings of intersecting surfaces
  are not handled properly. This occurs when Atoms are rendered with
  larger vanderWaals percentages (such as 50% or more).

<para>
  Please give us feedback on what features you would use and would like to
  see. This will help us prioritize future development.
