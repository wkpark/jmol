      <section title="Release/distribution mechanism">
	<p>
	  Test releases will be made on this page. Releases will be a single
	  .zip file that contains test prerelease. You can unzip this file
	  using standard tools, including unzip, pkunzip, winzip, and jar.
	  We do not plan to release sample files or support code. For those
	  who are interested, source code is always available through
	  anonymous CVS checkout.

      <p>

	  <li>
	    Fixed bug where angle measurement were sometimes not drawn
	  </li>

	    Measurements will now automatically render in either
	    white or black, whichever contrasts most with your
	    background color
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    some internal code repackaging
	  </li>
	</ul>

	    <i>Give me the code!</i>
	    Jmol10pre22.zip
	  </font>
	</a>
      </p>
      <p>
	<a href="Jmol10pre20.zip">
	  <font size="-1">
	    <i>Give me the old code</i> Jmol10pre20.zip
	  </font>
	</a>
      </p>
      <p>
	Unzip the code using the tool of your choice. It will unzip into
	a subdirectory of the current directory.
      </p>
      <p>
	The Java <b>jar</b> tool will work fine since a .jar is the same
	format as .zip : <b>jar xf Jmol10pre22.zip</b>
      </p>
      <p>
	To run the jmol application you can type: <b>java -jar Jmol.jar</b>
	<br/>With most GUIs, you also be able to double-click on Jmol.jar
	to launch it. (If this doesn't work then create an association
	for files with the extension .jar)
