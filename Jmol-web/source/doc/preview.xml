    <section title="What the next generation Jmol will look like">

      <p>
	Jmol has undergone a number of changes this year. Many of these
	changes were motivated by the goal of turning Jmol into a viable
	alternative for the Chime Plug-in. 
      </p>
      <p>
	In the spring the RasMol/Chime script compiler and interpreter
	were written. That code was introduced in release 6 of Jmol. 
      </p>
      <p>
	More recently, the graphics engine has been completely rewritten
	to provide true 3D rendering capabilities. It is a software
	implementation designed for rendering molecules and does not
	require any special hardware. 
      </p>
      <p>
	These pages demonstrate the pre-release development version of
	the Jmol applet, combining simple examples of RasMol/Chime
	script commands with 3D rendering. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The pages demo the capabilities of rendering 
        <a href="demo/atoms">atoms</a>, 
        <a href="demo/bonds">bonds</a>, 
        <a href="demo/trace">biochemical concepts</a>, 
        <a href="demo/dots">dotted surfaces</a>,
        and there is 
        <a href="demo/bwhite/index.html">one page</a>,
        that shows a Chime web application that has been
	  converted to Jmol.
