    <title>Sneak Preview of Jmol v10</title>
    
    <section title="What will Jmol v10 look like?">

      <p>
	Jmol has undergone a number of changes this year. Many of these
	changes were motivated by the goal of turning Jmol into a viable
	alternative for the Chime Plug-in.
	<a href="http://www.mdlchime.com">http://www.mdlchime.com</a>
      </p>
      <p>
	In the spring the RasMol/Chime script compiler and interpreter
	were written. That code was introduced in Jmol v6. 
      </p>
      <p>
	More recently, the graphics engine has been completely rewritten
	to provide true 3D rendering capabilities. It is a software
	implementation designed and optimized for rendering molecules.
	It does not require any special hardware and will run on most
	popular browsers with Java support (including those with
	Java 1.1 JVMs).
      </p>
      <p>
	These pages demonstrate the pre-release development version of
	the Jmol applet, combining simple examples of RasMol/Chime
	script commands with 3D rendering:
	<ul>
	  <li><a href="[root]/demo/atoms">atoms</a></li>
	  <li><a href="[root]/demo/bonds">bonds</a></li>
	  <li><a href="[root]/demo/trace">protein backbones</a></li>
	  <li><a href="[root]/demo/dots">dotted surfaces</a></li>
	</ul>
      </p>
      <p>
	To facilitate conversion of existing web pages built with
	the Chime plug-in, we have written a perl script which will
	identify Chime &lt;embed ...&gt; tags and replace them
	with the appropriate jmol &lt;applet ...&gt; tags. The
	chime2jmol.pl script handles Chime buttons as well as
	the Chime applet itself.
      </p>
      <p>
	This page shows a Chime application that was converted to
	jmol using the chime2jmol.pl perl script:
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    <a href="[root]/demo/bwhite/index.html">hemoglobin lecture</a>
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </p>
