	    This shows the backbone of a protein macromolecule by
	    creating artificial 'backbone' bonds between alpha carbons.
	    Backbone radius can be specified in angstroms.<br />

	    By default, the backbone bond color is inherited from the
	    atoms (as with other bonds). You can explicitly change
	    the backbone color. <br />
	    <script>
	      jmolRadioGroup([
	        ["color backbone none", null, "checked"],
		"color backbone firebrick",
		"color backbone greenyellow",
		"color backbone structure"
		]);

	    This shows a spline trace of a protein backbone.
	    The hermite spline curve passes through the mid-points
	    between alpha carbon atoms<br />
	    <b>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;trace
	      <script>
		jmolRadioGroup([
		["trace off", "off ", "checked"],
		["trace 0.4", "0.4 "],

		["trace structure", "structure"]
	      ]);

	    <br />

	    With color by 'structure' you get different colors for
	    HELIX, TURN, and SHEET. Color by 'amino' and color by
	    'shapely' assign different colors
	    to different amino acids.<br />
	    <script>
	      jmolRadioGroup([
	        ["color trace none", null, "checked"],
		"color trace structure",
		"color trace amino",
		"color trace shapely"
		]);
