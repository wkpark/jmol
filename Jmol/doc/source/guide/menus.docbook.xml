      <section>
	<title>Display Tab</title>
	<para>
	  In these frame a few display settings can be changed. By default
	  anti-aliasing is turned off. Turning it on improves the images
	  considerably but will also reduce performance.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Note: The 1.3.1 JVM which ships with Macintosh OS X and OS X 10.2
	  (Jaguar) has crash bugs with some pixel interpolation and
	  anti-aliasing operations. Therefore, you may need to disable the
	  use of Java Graphics2D on this platform.

	  they would occupy. So bonds are drawn to the outer circumference
	  of where the atom would be. Compare with *None*
	</para>

	  This option can be useful when used in conjunction with 
	  atom labels to display atom type.

	<title>None</title>
	<para>

    <section>
      <title>Wireframe Rotation</title>
      <para>
	This option may be checked if performance is unacceptable when
	manipulating large molecules. 
	When this option is checked, wireframe rendering is used for
	displayed atoms and bonds during rotations, translations, and
	zoom operations. The molecule is rendered according to the current
	settings when the mouse is released.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Perspective Depth</title>
      <para>
	This option controls rendering with perspective depth. When this
	option is unchecked molecules are rendered as a flat projection
	onto the screen. When checked, sizes and distances are adjusted
	for a camara perspective.
      </para>
      <para>
	For a good example of this take a look at some of the crystal
	structures, such as <filename>samples/CdSe_nanocrystal.xyz</filename>
	or <filename>samples/HfO2_on_Si_relax.in</filename>
      </para>
      <para>
	Alternatively, turn on the bounding box (see below).
      </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Axes</title>
      <para>
	Displays cartesian axes with the origin at the center of the
	bounding box defined by the extreme coordinates of the molecule.
      </para>
      <para>
	Note that the positive Y axis is at the top, unlike RasMol.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Bounding Box</title>
      <para>
	Displays the bounding box, defined by the extreme coordinates
	of the centers of the atoms in each of the three dimensions.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Hydrogens</title>
      <para>

    <section>
      <title>Define center</title>
      <para>
	Defines the center of rotation for the molecule to be the
	geometric center of the selected molecules.
      </para>
      <para>
	If no atoms are selected the the center is reset to the center
	of the bounding box defined by the extreme atom centerpoints
	in each of the x, y, and z dimensions. This is the default.
      </para>
      <para>
	If one atom is selected then it becomes the center of rotation.
      </para>
      <para>
	If two or more atoms are selected then the center becomes the point
	defined by the mean of the x, y, and z coordinates.
      </para>
      <para>
	{If you think there is a better definition for this
	(center of gravity? center of the bounding box?)
	then let us know and we can either change this or add a
	new definition.}
