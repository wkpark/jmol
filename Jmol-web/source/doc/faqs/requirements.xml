    <p>
      300 Mhz CPU + 64 Mb RAM<br />
      There is no absolute minimum. Performance is a function of
      molecule size, window size, and image complexity. <br />
      (On MacOS 9 you need more horsepower to make up for poor
      Java performance.)

  <section title="What are the recommended hardware requirements?">
    <p>
      600 Mhz CPU + 256 Mb RAM -- Of course, more is better.

    <p>
      Twice as many pixels means twice as much work ...

	   "Is OpenGL or 3D hardware required to run the JmolApplet?">
    <p>
      No special hardware is required to run the JmolApplet.
      The graphics engine is a z-buffer implemented in Java,
      and designed for rendering molecules. <i>(In fact, designed
      just for Jmol.)</i>

  <section title="Performance is great! Why is it so fast?">
    <p>
      It does not use any Java graphics calls. The entire
      image is built and sent to the screen with one
      java.awt.Graphics.drawImage operation.

  <section title="Rendering speed is really slow. What can I do?">
    <ul>
      <li>Get a faster machine</li>
      <li>Convince Sun to fix graphics performance problems</li>
      <li>Get the source code and speed it up</li>
    </ul>

  <section title="Why is the applet slow on Netscape/MacOS 9?">
    <p>
      It is an old Java Virtual Machine that is an interpreter. More
      modern JVMs compile the java bytecodes.
