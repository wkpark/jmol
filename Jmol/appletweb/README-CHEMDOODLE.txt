To use the ChemDoodle plug-in for JmolCore.js, you will need to download 
ChemDoodleWeb.js from iChemLabs. 

Do not use ChemDoodleWeb-libs.js if you wish to have compatibility with MSIE 
(Until ChemDoodleWeb-libs upgrades to jQuery 1.7).

We provide here the three components of that file and will upgrade as necessary 
upon request. Those are:

 jQuery.min.js, mousewheel.js, and gl-matrix-min.js

See JmolCore.js comments for more detail relating to using Jmol's ChemDoodle plug-in.

See also http://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/chemdoodle for more examples.

at the iChemLabs site carefully. All commercial use requires licensing from iChemLabs.
