class NBORequest {

//  Guiding logic:
//    
//
//    -- User attempts to switch tab model-run-view etc. while a request to NBOServe is pending.
//
//   Option 1: Jmol silently kills the pending request.
//
//   Option 2: Jmol notifies user that a request is in process and offers to NOT change modules.
//   "A request is already processing. Do you want to cancel that request and switch modules?"
//
//   Option 3: Jmol refuses request, notifying user that a request is in process, and we must wait for that to complete.
//   "A request is already processing. Please wait."
//
//
//   -- User makes second request in module while request is already pending.
//
//   Option 1: Jmol silently kills the pending request.
//
//   Option 2: Jmol notifies user that a request is in process and offers to NOT carry out this request.
//   "A request is already processing. Do you want to cancel that request?
//
//   Option 3: Jmol refuses request, notifying user that a request is in process, and we must wait for that to complete.
//   "A request is already processing. Please wait."
//
//   Option 4: Jmol queues request notifying user that a request is in  process, and this request will be processed as soon as the earlier request is completed.
//   "A request is already processing. Your request has been queued."
//
//   Option 5: Jmol asks the user what to do:
//
//   "A request is already processing. What would you like to do?"
//
//   [cancel pending request] [queue this request] [cancel this request]
//
//
//   - User attempts to close the NBO plug-in to return to Jmol proper.
//
//   Option 1: Jmol silently kills the pending request.
//
//   Option 2: Jmol notifies user that a request is in process and offers to NOT to quit NBO.
//
//   Option 3: NBO continues to process, just does so in the background.
//
//
//   - User attempts to close Jmol entirely.
//
//   Option 1: Jmol silently kills the pending request.
//
//   Option 2: Jmol notifies user that a request is in process and offers to NOT to quit Jmol.
//
//
//   I see how Jmol can kill NBOServe. But what if NBOServe is blocked at that  moment, waiting for a ray-tracer or gennbo job?
//
//   Q: Does the ray-tracer or gennbo job also die?
//   Q: If it does, won't we be left with incomplete or garbage files? What do we do about that?
//   Q: If it does not, what happens when, a few seconds later, we spawn a new one? Sounds dangerous to me.
//
//    Q: How do we determine easily exactly what the status of NBOServe is at any time? Where that status includes:
//
//   1 - initializing
//   2 - waiting for request
//   3 - processing request (expect *start*/*end* sequence soon)
//   4 - stopping (finalizing; cleaning up)
//   5 - dead
