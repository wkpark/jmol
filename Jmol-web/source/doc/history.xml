    <section title="The origins of Jmol">

      <p>
        Jmol was originally intended to be a fully functional replacement for
        XMol which was a molecular viewing program developed at the Minnesota
        Supercomputer Center. Although the program executables were
        distributed, the source code was not available to users, and since the
        program has not been maintained, the free binary versions have become
        obsolete. For example, the SGI version of XMol does not run on IRIX 6.x
        because IRIX has switched to a new executable format.

      <p>
        XMol's demise left a need for a similar tool. Dan Gezelter, the
        originator of Jmol, chose to avoid the same problems by making
        Jmol open source.  Although it has not
        completely met the goal of functionally replacing XMol, Jmol duplicates many
        of the most useful features, and in some ways, it has surpassed XMol
        functionality. In time, Jmol will hopefully include even more advanced
        features.

        Jmol was started as an OpenScience project which is dedicated to
        writing and releasing free and open source scientific software. For more
