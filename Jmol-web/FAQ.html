    <H3>1) What is Jmol?</H3>
    
    <p>Jmol is an <a href="http://www.opensource.org"
        target="_top">open-source</a> molecule viewer and editor. It
      was originally intended to be a fully functional replacement for <a
        href="http://www.networkcs.com/msc/docs/xmol/" target="_top">XMol</a>,
      but along the way, we've tried to improve some parts of the
      XMol interface that we found annoying. 
      Jmol is written in <a href="http://java.sun.com/"
        target="_top">Java</a> using the <a
        href="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/index.html"
        target="_top">Swing</a> GUI components.  After we duplicate the
      functionality of XMol, we will be adding features of particular
      interest to the chemical community, including molecule editing, 
      simple force-field based minimizations, molecular dynamics 
      (microcanonical ensemble), and Langevin dynamics (canonical ensemble).
    </p>

    <h3>2) Why do we need another Molecule Viewer?</h3> 

    <p>There are really two reasons:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Animation.  We do chemical dynamics, and we need to see what
        our simulations look like at different times.  We weren't aware
        of any molecule viewers out there (besides XMol) that do
        animations.</li>

      <li>The XMol source code is not freely available, and the number of
        machines it runs on is extremely limited (the free binary version
        does not even run under IRIX 6.x).  From our reading of the <a
          href="http://www.networkcs.com/msc/docs/xmol/faq.html"
          target="_top">XMol FAQ</a>, the authors of XMol are not
        amenable to making the source available, and they do not even sell
        the binary version as a product.  XMol is also restricted to a
        UNIX/X environment, and Jmol works anywhere that you can get a
        Java 1.1 VM to run.</li>

       <li>Normal modes.  Jmol animates normal modes computed via a number 
     of other ab initio software packages.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>3) How far along is Jmol?</h3> 

    <p>Jmol is <em><b>beta</b></em> software.  Many things work: it
      can be used as an animator of multi-frame XYZ files, it can animate the 
precalculated normal modes from many ab initio quantum chemistry
programs (Gaussian, GAMESS, ACES2, ADF) it can read PDB files and a
wide range of ab initio quantum chemistry log files, and it can 
output GIFs, JPGs and PPMs of what is displayed on screen.  
PostScript output is of very high quality if you are using Java2.  It
can measure distances, angles, and dihedrals for any frame in 
the animation, and it is a generally useful tool for the chemical 
sciences.</p>
    
    <h3>4) Is Jmol an Applet?  Can it be run from inside a web browser?</h3> 

    <p>Jmol is a Java-based application.  It reads and writes
      files on the local disk which contain information about atomic
      coordinates.  Applets are not permitted to write local files, so
      we made Jmol an application instead.   We are working on a 
      functional <a href="JmolApplet.html">applet version of Jmol</a> that 
      is available via the Jmol web site.</P>


    <h3>5) What do I need to run Jmol?</h3>
    
    <p>A Java 1.1, 1.2 or 1.3 VM.  We like Sun's <a
        href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/index.html"
        target="_top">JDK1.3</a> and IBM's <a href="http://www.ibm.com/java/jdk/download/index.html" target="_top">version of the 1.3 JDK</a>, but Jmol should work with other
      VMs. Macintosh users should have <a target="_top"
        href="http://devworld.apple.com/java/text/download.html">MRJ
        2.2.2</a> or higher.  Users of Linux on PPC or Sparc processors 
        can get the latest Linux JVM at the <a target="_top"
        href="http://www.blackdown.org/java-linux/ports.html">Blackdown</a>
      site.  If you use FreeBSD, you should go to the <a
        href="http://www.freebsd.org/java/" target="_top">JDK for
        FreeBSD</a> page.  We will be migrating to Jmol to Java 1.2
      (a.k.a. Java2) in the very near future, so consider upgrading your
      JVM.</p>

    <h3>6) What do I need to compile Jmol?</h3> 

    <p> A Java2 (java1.2 or 1.3) JDK.  We've also been using
      <a href="http://www10.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jikes "
        target="_top">Jikes</a>, the very fast java compiler from the
      IBM's AlphaWorks site to compile Jmol, but you don't necessarily 
      need to have it.  Developers who use Macs will want to grab
      the <a href="http://devworld.apple.com/java/text/download.html#sdk" TARGET="_top">MRJ SDK</a> from Apple.
