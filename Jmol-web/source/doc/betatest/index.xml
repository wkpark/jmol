    <section title="Jmol v10 Beta Testing">

      <p>
	Jmol v10 is a major reimplementation of many major
	Jmol subsystems. Major features/changes include:
	<ul>
	  <li>3d graphics engine</li>
	  <li>additional script commands</li>
	  <li>JmolAppletControl buttons</li>
	  <li>reorientation of coordinate system to be RasMol/Chime
	  compatible</li>
	</ul>
      </p>
      <p>
	Along with these new features comes a new set of bugs.
	Thank you for helping us test out new releases of Jmol and
	helping us find these bugs.
      </p>

      <section title="Bug reporting procedures">
	<p>
	  If you can, please submit bugs directly into the bug tracking
	  database provided by sourceforge. This will save us a little
	  time and, most importantly, will ensure that your bugs do not
	  get lost.

      <section title="Support and communications">
	<p>
	During the test program, support will be provided through the
	<b>jmol-users@lists.sf.net</b> mailing list. If you are not on
	the list and would like to subscribe you can go to
	<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/jmol-users"
	><b>this page to subscribe</b></a>
	</p>

      <section title="Release/distribution mechanism">
	<p>
	  Test releases will be made on this page. Releases will be a single
	  .zip file that contains test prerelease. You can unzip this file
	  using standard tools, including unzip, pkunzip, winzip, and jar.
	  We do not plan to release sample files or support code. For those
	  who are interested, source code is always available through
	  anonymous CVS checkout.

    <section title="Jmol10pre1">
      <p>
	Jmol version 10 pre-release 1 is our first test release. It has the
	following functional limitations:
	<ul>
	  <li>Only supports .xyz, .mol, and .pdb files</li>
	  <li>Does not handle animations</li>
	  <li>Does not handle crystal cells</li>
	  <li>
	    Will not automatically recognize protein secondary structures
	  </li>
	  <li>Will not render ribbons nor cartoons</li>
	  <li>Will not render isosurfaces</li>
	  <li>Does not handle nucleotides</li>
	</ul>
      </p>
      <p>
	<a href="Jmol10pre1.zip"
	   ><font size="+1"><i>Give me the code!</i> Jmol10pre1.zip</font></a>
      </p>
      <p>
	Unzip the code using the tool of your choice. It will unzip into
	a subdirectory of the current directory.
      </p>
      <p>
	The Java <b>jar</b> tool will work fine since a .jar is the same
	format as .zip : <b>jar xf Jmol10pre1.zip</b>
      </p>
      <p>
	To run the jmol application you can type: <b>java -jar jmol.jar</b>
	<br/>With most GUIs, you also be able to double-click on jmol.jar
	to launch it. (If this doesn't work then create an association
	for files with the extension .jar)
