This tab is designed to produce a web page template (no explanatory text)
that displays a single resizable Jmol applet alongside a scrolling pane
containing text and Jmol script buttons. The buttons can change what is
displayed in the Jmol applet. What they do can be defined by setting up Jmol
with the view you want the user to see. This panel can be opened once and
returned to anytime. An example picture of such a page is shown below:<br>
<img style="border: 1px solid ; width: 250px; height: 199px;"
alt="picture of a Resizable web page" src="script_button.png"><br>
<br>
<b><i>Instructions</i></b> <br>
<br>
1) Set the relative path to the Jmol applet on you web site from where you
will put the folder (directory) containing the files created by this
program.  Each "../" means step up one directory level.  Do not forget to
account for the fact that the page produced by this program is inside a
folder (directory) that you will be adding to your web site.  Example: Jmol
applet is in directory /www/applets/java/jmol and your web site is in the
directory /www/yourname.  You will be adding one more level for this page
(e.g. /www/yourname/thispage).  The correct path to the Jmol applet is
../../applets/java/jmol. <br>


<p>2) Put your name(s) in the Author space. This will add you as the author
in the page meta data that is used for searching.</p>

<p>3) Add the title you want to appear in the browser window title bar. This
does not have to be the same as the title you will use for the page.</p>

<p>4) Set the percentage of the window width that you want Jmol to occupy.
<br>
<br>
5) If not already done, open the first file you want to appear in your page
using the File..Open.. menu in the Jmol viewer. <br>
<br>
6) Set the state of the model (zoom, rotate, select, change colors, add
orbitals, set the molecule spinning, etc.)exactly the way you want it to
appear on the web page. <br>
<br>
7) Click on the "Add Present Jmol State as Instance" button. <br>
<br>
8) Repeat for as many different displays as you wish. A button will be added
to the web page that will create each display when the user clicks on them.
You do not need to load a new file each time if you are just modifying the
way the previous one is displayed. <br>
<br>
9) When you are done, click on "Save HTML as..." Provide either the name of a
new directory for this page or the name of the HTML file (.htm or .html) you
want to create or replace. All necessary files will be created in the same
directory. These include the HTML page itself, the JavaScript file
JmolPopin.js, and three files for each model: a data file, a Jmol script, and
a PNG image. If a new directory is indicated, the HTML file will be created
in that directory and have the same name, with ".html" appended. <br>
<br>
10) Open the HTML file in your favorite web editor and add you explanatory
text and anything else you wish. As long as you do not alter the inside of
the tables where Jmol will be displayed, you should be able to change the
page without disrupting the JavaScript that controls the behavior of Jmol.
