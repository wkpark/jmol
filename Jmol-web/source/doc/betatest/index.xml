    <title>Jmol v10 Beta Test Program</title>
    
    <section title="Jmol v10 Beta Testing">

      <p>
	Jmol v10 is a complete rewrite of most of Jmol.
	Major features/changes include:
	<ul>
	  <li>substantial performance improvements</li>
	  <li>true 3d graphics engine</li>
	  <li>support for macromolecule secondary structure graphics</li>
	  <li>additional script commands</li>
	  <li>support for the RasMol/Chime coordinate system orientation</li>
	  <li>JmolAppletControl buttons</li>
	</ul>
      </p>
      <p>
	Along with these new features comes a new set of bugs.
	Thank you for helping us test out new releases of Jmol and
	helping us find these bugs.
      </p>

      <p>
	<i>
	  At this point, we feel obligated to admit that this is not
	  really being conducted as a formal <strong>beta test.</strong>
	  During the test phase we are continuing to make substantial
	  changes to the code; changes that go far beyond a beta test.
	  But we are continuing to develop and enhance the code,
	  regardless of what we call it.

	<p>
	  If you can, please submit bugs directly into the bug tracking
	  database provided by sourceforge. This will save us a little
	  time and, most importantly, will ensure that your bugs do not
	  get lost.

	  During the test program, support will be provided through the
	  <b>jmol-users@lists.sf.net</b> mailing list. If you are not on

      <section title="Release/distribution mechanism">
	<p>
	  Test releases will be made on this page. Releases will be a single
	  .zip file that contains test prerelease. You can unzip this file
	  using standard tools, including unzip, pkunzip, winzip, and jar.
	  We do not plan to release sample files or support code. For those
	  who are interested, source code is always available through
	  anonymous CVS checkout.

    <section title="Jmol10pre8">
      <p>
	Jmol version 10 pre-release 8 was released on 28 Mar 2004.
	This release includes
	the following enhancements:
	<ul>
	  <li>initial support for CIF/mmCIF files</li>
	  <li>better support for ShelX .res files</li>
	  <li>
	    initial support for atom <strong>hover</strong> with
	    the addition of the 'hover {labelFormat}' command
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    support for --script and -s as a script parameter to the
	    Jmol application
	  </li>
	  <li>lightened default 'carbon' color</li>
	  <li>corrected bugs in atom expressions with numeric group IDs</li>
	  <li>corrected bugs in label and font control </li>
	  <li>adjusted mouse gestures</li>
	</ul>
	This release continues to have the
	following functional limitations:
	<ul>
	  <li>Supports .xyz, .mol, .pdb, .res and .cif files</li>
	  <li>Does not handle vibrations</li>
	  <li>Does not have full crystal cell support</li>
	</ul>
	No work is planned in the following areas until at least July 2004
	<ul>
	  <li>nucleotide graphic shapes</li>
	  <li>ribbons support</li>
	  <li>
	    automatic recognition of protein secondary structures using DSSP
	    or related algorithms
	  </li>
	  <li>isosurfaces</li>
	  <li>full animation support</li>
	</ul>
      </p>
      <p>
	Additional notes regarding support for .cif files
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Both cartesian and fractional coordinates are supported.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Protein secondary structures of helix, turn, and sheet are
	    supported.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <i>No</i> bonding information is read from CIF/mmCIF files ...
	    bonds are generated through autobonding.
	    (It would be a big help to me if someone could explain to
	    me how bonds are defined in CIF/mmCIF files.)
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Supporting mmCIF files required some fundamental changes to the
	    underlying data structures for atom expression queries. This
	    had an impact on PDB files. Therefore, some bugs were
	    <i>probably</i> introduced. Please be aware of this and
	    report any incorrect behavior with atom expressions when
	    working with either mmCIF or PDB files.
	  </li>
	</ul>

	Unzip the code using the tool of your choice. It will unzip into
	a subdirectory of the current directory.
      </p>
      <p>
	The Java <b>jar</b> tool will work fine since a .jar is the same
	format as .zip : <b>jar xf Jmol10pre8.zip</b>
      </p>
      <p>
	To run the jmol application you can type: <b>java -jar Jmol.jar</b>
	<br/>With most GUIs, you also be able to double-click on Jmol.jar
	to launch it. (If this doesn't work then create an association
	for files with the extension .jar)
