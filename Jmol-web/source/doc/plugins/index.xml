      <p>
        Plugins are small jar files which extend the functionality of
        the core Jmol program.
        A full list of plugins can be found at the 
        <a href="http://cdk.sourceforge.net/plugins.html">CDK Plugins</a>
        website, which also explains where these plugins are installed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both Jmol $VERSION$ and Jmol 10 support plugins. The latter needs to 
        be started as <i>java -Dmodel=cdk -jar jmol.jar</i>. The first cannot run
        all plugins though, e.g. the DirBrowser plugin does not work.
        The RSSViewer plugin does work in both versions.

      <p>
        Jmol v10 by default includes the DirBrowser plugin.
