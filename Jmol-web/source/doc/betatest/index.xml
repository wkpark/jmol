    <section title="Jmol v10 Beta Testing">

      <p>
	Jmol v10 is a complete rewrite of Jmol.
	Major features/changes include:
	<ul>
	  <li>substantial performance improvements</li>
	  <li>true 3d graphics engine that requires no special hardware</li>
	  <li>support for macromolecule secondary structure graphics</li>
	  <li>additional script commands</li>
	  <li>support for the RasMol/Chime coordinate system orientation</li>
	  <li>JmolAppletControl buttons</li>
	</ul>
      </p>
      <p>
	Along with these new features comes a new set of bugs.
	Thank you for helping us test out new releases of Jmol and
	helping us find these bugs.
      </p>

      <p>
	<i>
	  At this point, we feel obligated to admit that this is not
	  really being conducted as a formal <strong>beta test.</strong>
	  During the test phase we are continuing to make substantial
	  changes to the code; changes that go far beyond a beta test.
	  But we are continuing to develop and enhance the code,
	  regardless of what we call it.

      <section title="Bug reporting procedures">
	<p>
	  If you can, please submit bugs directly into the bug tracking
	  database provided by sourceforge. This will save us a little
	  time and, most importantly, will ensure that your bugs do not
	  get lost.

      <section title="Support and communications">
	<p>
	  During the test program, support will be provided through the
	  <b>jmol-users@lists.sf.net</b> mailing list. If you are not on
	  the list and would like to subscribe you can go to
	  <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/jmol-users"

      <section title="Release/distribution mechanism">
	<p>
	  Test releases will be made on this page. Releases will be a single
	  .zip file that contains test prerelease. You can unzip this file
	  using standard tools, including unzip, pkunzip, winzip, and jar.
	  We do not plan to release sample files or support code. For those
	  who are interested, source code is always available through
	  anonymous CVS checkout.

      <p>
	Jmol version 10 pre-release 10 was released on Sat 22 May 2004.
	This release includes
	the following enhancements:
	<ul>
	  <li>improved support for Ribbons</li>
	  <li>cartoons which are more RasMol-like</li>
	  <li>support for nucleotide chain graphic shapes</li>
	  <li>support for nucleotide chain hbonds</li>
	  <li>improved support for CML files</li>
	  <li>improved support for Gaussian output</li>
	  <li>bug fixes</li>
	</ul>
	The following areas are still not supported. We hope to begin
	work in one or more of these areas over the coming weeks:
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    automatic recognition of protein secondary structures
	    using DSSP or related algorithms
	  </li>
	  <li>isosurfaces</li>
	  <li>full animation support</li>
	</ul>
      </p>

	  </font>
	</a>
      </p>
      <p>
	Unzip the code using the tool of your choice. It will unzip into
	a subdirectory of the current directory.
      </p>
      <p>
	The Java <b>jar</b> tool will work fine since a .jar is the same
	format as .zip : <b>jar xf Jmol10pre10.zip</b>
      </p>
      <p>
	To run the jmol application you can type: <b>java -jar Jmol.jar</b>
	<br/>With most GUIs, you also be able to double-click on Jmol.jar
	to launch it. (If this doesn't work then create an association
	for files with the extension .jar)
