  <section title="What are the minimum hardware requirements?">
    <p>
      400 Mhz CPU + 128 Mb RAM<br />
      There is no absolute minimum. Performance is a function of
      molecule size, window size, and image complexity. <br />
      (On MacOS 9 you need more horsepower to make up for poor
      Java performance.)

  <section title="What are the recommended hardware requirements?">
    <p>
      750 Mhz CPU + 256 Mb RAM -- Of course, more is better.

  <section title="Which JVM should I use on Win32 Internet Explorer?">
    <p>
      We strongly recommend that you install the Sun Java Plug-in
      from <a href="http://www.java.com">www.java.com</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Jmol runs fine on the Microsoft JVM that was included with
      Internet Explorer up until 2002(?). However, since Microsoft
      no longer supports this product, we strongly recommend that
      you upgrade.

   title="Why does it get so much slower when I make the window bigger?">
    <p>
      Twice as many pixels means twice as much work ... and if your
      applet is twice as wide and twice as high then you have 4 times
      as many pixels so you get 1/4 the speed.

   title="Is OpenGL or 3D hardware required to run the JmolApplet?">
    <p>
      No special hardware is required to run the JmolApplet.
      The graphics engine is a z-buffer implemented in Java,
      and designed for rendering molecules. <i>(In fact, designed
      just for Jmol.)</i>

  <section title="Performance is great! Why is it so fast?">
    <p>
      It does not use any Java graphics calls. The entire
      image is built offscreen and sent to the screen with one
      java.awt.Graphics.drawImage operation.
    </p>

  <section title="Rendering speed is really slow. What can I do?">
    <ul>
      <li>Get a faster machine ... something built this century</li>
      <li>Convince Sun to fix graphics performance problems</li>
      <li>Review the source code and help speed it up</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section title="Why is the applet slow on Netscape/MacOS 9?">
    <p>
      It is an old Java Virtual Machine that is an interpreter. More
      modern JVMs compile the java bytecodes.
