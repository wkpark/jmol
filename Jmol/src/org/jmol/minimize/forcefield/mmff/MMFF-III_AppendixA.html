Supplementary Material for: "Merck Molecular Force Field. III. Molecular

Chem.</i>, <b>17</b>, 553-586 (1996).<p>
<p>
     This appendix discusses the format of the parameter tables (Tables III -
VI) and describes in detail how requests for parameters are matched to entries
in the tables.<p>
<p>
     <b>A.1. Bond Stretching Parameters.</b>  The first column in Table III,
labeled BTIJ, lists the bond type index discussed in the "QUARTIC BOND 
STRETCHING" subsection of the section on "Form of MMFF94 ...".  The second
and third columns list the atom types, and the fourth and fifth give the force
constant in mdynes/Angs and the reference bond length in Angs.  The last,
labeled "Origin/Comment", distinguishes "C94" core MMFF94 parameters, derived
from <i>ab initio</i> data as described in this paper, from parameters derived
in the extended parameterization described in Paper V [1]
(usually labeled "E94").  As can be seen, the bond-type index BTIJ
normally takes the value "0" but occasionally takes the value "1".  The latter
value denotes a formally single bond between <i>sp</i>- or <i>sp2</i>-hybridized 
atoms of types that can participate in
multiple (double or triple) bonding.  Thus, the parameter whose three numerical
indices are "0 2 2" describes a double bond between olefinic carbons (reference
bond length, 1.333 Angs), whereas the next-listed parameter with numerical
indices "1 2 2" describes the delocalized single bond between two such carbons
in, for example, butadiene (reference bond length, 1.430 Angs).  This last
parameter, as it happens, is labeled "#C94", where the "#" sign indicates that
a "compromise" value has been chosen for the reference bond length (cf. the
discussion of 1,3-butadiene in the "EXPERIMENTAL MOLECULAR GEOMETRIES"
subsection of the section on "Performance of MMFF94").  Other labels used in the full
parameter file include "X94" for parameters whose reference bond lengths were
derived from additional MP2/6-31G* data in MMFF's extended parameterization <a
href="#fn1">[1]</a>, "#X94" for parameters of similar computational origin but
for which a compromise reference bond length was chosen, and "#E94" for bonds
to hydrogen for which a poorly determined crystallographic bond length was
replaced by an empirical rule value; see Paper V<a href="#fn1"> [1]</a> for
further details.<p>
<p>
     No wildcarded parameters are defined for bond stretching interactions.
Rather, when a needed bond parameter is not found in the parameter file, MMFF94
employs an empirical rule<a href="#fn1"> [1]</a> to assign a reference bond
length using a modified form of the Schomaker-Stevenson equation <a
href="#fn2">[2]</a>, and assigns the force constant<a href="#fn1"> [1]</a> from
an inverse sixth-power relationship<a href="#fn3"> [3]</a> .  The bond
parameters labeled "E94", for example, take their reference bond lengths from
fits to cystallographically determined structures and use the empirical
sixth-power rule to assign the force constant <a href="#fn1">[1]</a>.  <p>
<p>
     The canonical ordering reflected in the table is defined through an
integer index, CXB, that is computed as<p>
<p>
	CXB = MC*(<i>I</i>*MA + <i>J</i>) + <i>M</i>,<p>
<p>
where <i>M</i> denotes the bond-type index BT[IJ], MC is an integer equal to at
least the maximum permitted bond-type index + 1, MA is an integer at least
equal to the maximum numerical atom-type index + 1, and atom type <i>I</i> is
less than or equal to <i>J</i>.  Thus, <i>I</i> changes least rapidly and
<i>M</i> changes most rapidly, with the result that parameters that reference
the same atom types but different bond types appear consecutively in the
listing.  As for other terms in the MMFF94 energy expression, this ordering
allows a rapid binary search algorithm to be used to locate the parameters but
has no intrinsic effect on the matching of parameters to force-field
interaction terms.  <p>
<p>
      <b>A.2. Angle Bending Parameters.</b> The seven columns in Table IV
define the angle-type index AT[IJK], the atom types <i>I</i>, <i>J</i> and
<i>K</i> for the peripheral, central, and peripheral atoms in the angle, the
force constant in md-Angs/rad**2, the reference bond
angle in degrees, and the origin of the parameter, where "C94" and "E94" have
meanings analogous to those discussed above.  The full parameter file employs
other labels as well <a href="#fn4">[4]</a>.  The MMFF94 angle-bending
parameters also include parameters that have zero values for atom types
<i>I</i> and <i>K</i> and a zero value for the listed force constant; the first
parameter listed in Table IV, for example, is of this type.  These "default
parameter" entries are used for interactions <i>I-J-K </i>of angle-type
<i>M</i> = AT[IJK] when the parameter file contains neither the fully-qualified
<i>M:I-J-K </i>parameter nor any related parameter obtained by successively
equivalencing atom types <i>I</i>, <i>J</i>, and <i>K</i> to simpler atom types
in the manner described in Paper I <a href="#fn5">[5]</a>. In such a case, the
angle-type <i>M</i> and the central atom-type <i>J</i> are used to assign the
reference angle, and an empirical rule based on previously published work 
is then employed to calculate the force constant; if no
match on <i>M</i> and <i>J</i> is found, information relating to hydridization
and ring size is used to assign the reference value <a href="#fn1">[1]</a>.  The
"E94" parameters combine reference angles obtained by fitting to experimental
geometries with empirical-rule force constants.  The default reference angles
represent averages of explicitly parameterized reference angles for the same
angle type <i>M</i> and central atom type <i>J</i>.  See Paper V for further
information <a href="#fn1">[1]</a>.<p>
<p>
     The listed parameters employ angle-type indices ranging between 0 and 8.
Their meanings are as defined below:<p>
<i><p>
<pre>
 </i>AT[IJK]<i> </i>   Structural significance
-----------------------------------------------------
  0		   The angle <i>i-j-k</i> is a "normal" bond angle
  1 		   Either bond <i>i-j</i> or bond <i>j-k</i> has a bond type of 1
  2		   Bonds<i> i-j</i> and <i>j-k</i> each have bond types of 1; the sum is 2.
  3		   The angle occurs in a three-membered ring
  4		   The angle occurs in a four-membered ring
  5		   Is in a three-membered ring and the sum of the bond types is 1
  6		   Is in a three-membered ring and the sum of the bond types is 2
  7		   Is in a four-membered ring and the sum of the bond types is 1
  8		   Is in a four-membered ring and the sum of the bond types is 2
</pre><p>
     The canonical ordering of the angle parameters is such that the atom-type
index <i>J</i> changes least rapidly and the angle-type index <i>M</i> changes
most rapidly; atom type <i>I</i> is always less than or equal to <i>K</i> and
changes less rapidly.  As a result, all angle interactions having a common
central atom type appear consecutively in the listing.  The canonical-order
index that produces this ordering, CXA, is computed as:<p>
<p>
     CXA = MC*(<i>J</i>*MA**2 + <i>I</i>*MA + <i>K</i>) +
<i>M</i>,<p>
<p>
where MA is again at least the maximum atom type + 1, and MC is at least one
greater than the maximum angle-type index.  <p>
<p>
     <b>A.3. Stretch-Bend Parameters.</b>  The format of Table V for
stretch-bend parameters is similar to that employed for angle bending.  For a
given <i>i-j-k</i> interaction, two force constants, each given in units of
md/rad, arise for each listing in the parameter file.  The first,
k<i>ba</i>[IJK], couples <i>i-j-k</i> bending with the stretching of the
<i>i-j</i> bond, whereas the second, k<i>ba</i>[KJI], couples <i>i-j-k</i>
bending to <i>k-j</i> stretching.  The requisite reference bond lengths and
reference bond angle (cf. eq 5) are taken from the respective bond and angle
parameter sets, with the stretch-bend type index SBT[IJK] listed in the first
column serving with the atom types to establish the proper connection.  The
stretch-bend types are defined as shown below:<p>
<p><pre>
         SBT[IJK]      AT[IJK]	      BT[IJ]	       BT[JK]
    -------------------------------------------------------------
	  0		  0		 0		0
	  1	 	  1		 1		0
	  2		  2		 0		1
	  3		  2		 1		1
	  4		  4		 0		0
	  5		  3		 0		0
	  6		  5		 1		0
	  7		  5		 0		1
	  8		  6		 1		1
	  9		  7		 1		0
	 10		  7		 0		1
	 11		  8		 1		1
<p></pre>
Note that two stretch-bend types occur for each angle type for which the
associated bond-type indices sum to 1.  <p>
<p>
     Canonical order is established through an index, CXBA, that is computed
from the stretch-bend type and the atom types in the same manner as was
described above for the index CXA used for angle-bending parameters.  The
ordering of the tabulated parameters therefore follows the same prescription.<p>
<p>
     The matching of stretch-bend interactions to parameter file entries uses
the stretch-bend type <i>M</i> = SBT[IJK] and the atom types <i>I</i>, <i>J</i>,
and <i>K</i>.  No equivalencies are employed, but default force constants are
assigned whenever the fully qualified <i>M:I-J-K</i> parameter is not found
(cf. Paper V<a href="#fn1"> [1]</a>).  All the parameters listed in Table V are
labeled "C94", and thus represent core MMFF94 values derived by fitting to
HF/6-31G* energy derivatives.  The full parameter file includes some parameters
labeled "X94"; these parameters were derived from HF/6-31G* data in a
comparable manner to, but not as part of, the main "C94" parameterization
described in this paper.<p>
<p>
     <b>A.4. Out-of-Plane Bending Parameters.</b>  Of the four atom types that
characterize the parameters listed in Table VI, the second, labeled <i>J</i>,
corresponds to the central atom <i>j</i> to which the atoms <i>i</i>, <i>k</i>,
and <i>l</i> of types <i>I, K </i> and <i>L</i> are attached.  The force
constant, k<i>oop</i>[IJK;L], is given in units of md-A/rad**2.  In the individual interactions that appear in eq 6,
<i>l</i> represents the out-of-plane atom in the Wilson angle definition.  This
distinction does not affect the way in which the parameters are utilized,
however, because MMFF94 employs the same force constant for all three
out-of-plane angles.  The canonical index, CXO, used to order the parameters is
computed as:<p>
<p>
	CXO = <i>J</i>*MA**3 + <i>I</i>*MA**2 +
<i>K</i>*MA + <i>L</i>, <p>
<p>
where MA is as defined previously, <i>L</i> is greater than or equal to
<i>K</i>, and <i>K</i> is greater than or equal to <i>I</i>.  This ordering
groups together all out-of-plane entries that share a common central atom type
<i>J</i>.   <p>
<p>
     Unlike the interactions discussed in the previous subsections, the four
atom types suffice to characterize an out-of-plane parameter; no "bond type" or
"angle type" information is utilized at present.  The parameter search begins
with an attempt to locate the fully qualified parameter.  If this search is
unsuccessful, a staged search using more generic parameter types is performed
(cf. the "Implementation of MMFF ..." section in Paper I <a href="#fn5">[5]</a>).  The entries for which atom
types <i>I</i>, <i>K</i> and <i>L</i> are all zero serve as default values.
The default force constants represent, roughly, the average of the force
constants for the central atom type <i>J</i> derived in the fit to the
HF/6-31G* data.  All but two of nondefault entries in Table VI are labeled
"C94" and were derived from the HF/6-31G*  <i>ab initio</i> data as described
in the section entitled "Derivation of Quadratic Force Constants."  
The two entries labeled "#C94" are modified values chosen to
improve the representation of out-of-plane bending in amides (cf. the subsection 
on "GEOMETRIES FOR AMIDES AND UNSATURATED AMINES" in the "Performance of MMFF94" 
section).
Some default force constants are labeled "E94" in the full parameter table;
their values were assigned by analogy to computationally derived values found
for similar atom types <a href="#fn1">[1]</a>.  <p>
