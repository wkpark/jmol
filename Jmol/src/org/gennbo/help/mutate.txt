MUTATE IA formula (replace atom IA by the group\
                     of specified chemical 'formula',
                     if both are of consistent valency)

      Example:
       MUTATE 4 CH3     [remove monovalent atom 4 and
                 attach a methyl (CH3) radical in its
               place, preserving valence consistency]
