Jmol building notes

Building Jmol properly requires three projects:

Jmol
JSmol
JSpecView

- JSpecView: Jmol needs JSpecView's jar file, so if there are changes, to JSpecView, start there.
  Copy JSpecView.jar into jmol/jars

- Jmol: update org.jmol.viewer.Jmol.properties and check it in so that it gets a new time stamp.
        Jmol.properties is also used by JSmol (along with all the Jmol java files).

- JSmol: for testing, run buildfromjmol.xml, then buildtojstest.xml. This replaces ALL the files in
         jsmol/src/org and also create jsmol/site, which you can then run test.htm in. 
         buildtojstest.xml does not create minified files, so it is faster than buildtojs.xml.
         
         Test test test
         
- JSmol: run buildfromjmol.xml, then buildtojs.xml. This produces minified files and ultimately 
         creates dist/jsmol.zip, copying that also to jmol/appletweb. 

         Unzip dist/jsmol.zip and test it out, this time using jsmol.htm, which uses the minified 
         library.
         
         Test test test
                  
- JSmol: Update and check in jsmol files

- Jmol: Update and check in jmol files

    It is at this point that I make my own ZIP files and upload them into chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/zip.
    When I am creating chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/jsmol, I upload first as j
