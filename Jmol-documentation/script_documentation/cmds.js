While this documentation does not attempt to define these expressions completely, several examples are given here.

Positive numbers are minimum distances from the given atom to the nearest surface atom.||SYMOP|crystallographic symmetry operator that generated this atom; an integer starting with 1. This operator is only present if the file contains space group information and the file was {#.load~loaded} using the {{i, j, k}} option so as to generate symmetry-based atoms. To select only the original atoms prior to application of symmetry, you can either use "SYMOP=n", where n is the symmetry operator corresponding to "x,y,z", or you can specify instead simply "NOT symmetry" the way you might specify "NOT hydrogen". Note that atoms in special positions will have multiple operator matches. These atoms can be selected using the keyword SPECIALPOSITION.  || TEMPERATURE |PDB temperature factor; decimal number = PDB file columns 61-66; integer = this times 100||]<br /> In addition, the special crystallographic keyword CELL allows indicating a specific unit cell (using <b>cell =</b>) either in lattice integer notation (000-999) or as a coordinate in ijk space {{1 1 1}}. ANDing two cells, for example <b>cell=555 and cell=556</b> selects the atoms on the common face. <br /><br />The following functions are also supported:[||CONNECTED()| allows for selection of specific atoms based on their connectivity to other atoms.

This allows formation of commands such as <b>set unitCell {{1/2, 1/2, 1/2}}</b> to move the unit cell to a new crystallographic orgin (for display purposes only).

Many of these surfaces can be color-mapped. Two Jmol commands (<b>isosurface</b> and {#.mo~}) render isosurfaces. The <b>isosurface</b> command itself provides ultimate control over these surface renderings. Before using the <b>isosurface</b> command, if you are interested in rendering molecular orbitals, you should first take a look at the {#.mo~} command. <br /><br />The general syntax of the <b>isosurface</b> command is as follows:  <br />  <br /><b>isosurface [object id] [construction/mapping parameters] [surface object] [additional mapping-only parameters] MAP [color mapping dataset] [display options] </b> <br /> <br /> Data for these surfaces can be in the form of Gaussian CUBE or {misc/JVXL-format.pdf~JVXL (Jmol Voxel)} format files, molecular orbitals and their associated Gaussian or Slater basis functions from computational software packages, or a number of internally calculated surface types (Shroedinger hydrogen-like atomic orbitals, LCAO-"cartoon" orbitals, spheres, ellipsoids, tear-drop shaped lobes, user-defined functions f(x,y), and Jmol-calculated solvent surfaces (accessible or excluded). If a CUBE or JVXL file is used as the source, it need not be the file that was loaded using the {#.load~} command, which reads only the atom position, not the surface. A separate isosurface command is used to read the scalar field data and construct the isosurface. This <b>isosurface</b> represents the points in space where scalar values cross a specified "cutoff" value. Inside the surface, values are greater or equal to a specified positive cutoff or less than or equal to a specified negative cutoff. The default cutoff depends upon the type of object displayed, but for CUBE or JVXL files it is 0.02. Note that positive and negative surfaces may be created separately, or, using the SIGN keyword, they can be generated together. <br /><br />You can construct different isosurfaces with different shapes and sizes by reading the same CUBE file more than once with different parameters, or by reading different CUBE files or selecting different volumes in a given CUBE file or different surfaces contained in a given JVXL file. By naming these individual surfaces with unique identifiers you can control display settings and color for each of the surfaces independently. <br /><br />Color mapping of one object onto another is a simple as listing both an object and a dataset within the same isosurface command.

A simple sp3 model is used.||<b>ANGSTROMS</b>|For a cube file or user-defined function f(x,y), indicates that the volumetric definitions are in Angstroms instead of Bohr (default).||<b>ANISOTROPY {{a b c}}</b>|Sets the anisotropic distortion of an object in the x, y, and z directions.||<b>CENTER {{x y z}}</b>|Centers an atomic orbital, sphere, ellipsoid, or lobe at a specific point in molecular space. In the case of crystal structures, these may be {.#fractional~fractional coordinates}.||<b>CENTER (atom_exp)</b>|Centers an atomic orbital, sphere, ellipsoid, or lobe on a certain atom or at the geometric center of this set of atoms.||<b>CENTER $object</b>|Centers an atomic orbital, sphere, ellipsoid, or lobe on a certain drawn object such as a point, line, or plane.||<b>COLORSCHEME "xxx" </b>|Sets the color scheme to one of "roygb" (default rainbow), "rwb" (red-white-blue), "low" (red-green), or "high" (green-blue).||<b>COLOR &lt;color&gt;</b>|Colors an isosurface the specified color name or value. ||<b>COLOR/SIGN <br />&lt;color&gt; &lt;color&gt;</b>|Either term, COLOR or SIGN followed by two color names or values indicates to color the object based on the sign of the function (for use with atomic and molecular orbitals).||<b>COLOR ABSOLUTE <br />x.xxx y.yyy</b>|Indicates to color the specified range of value from one end to the other end of the color scheme. ||<b>CONTOUR n</b>|Specifically for a plane or f(x,y) object, sets the number of contours to be used. The default is for 11 contours.||<b>CONTOUR -n</b>|With a negative number, specifies for a plane or f(x,y) object the specific single contour to depict.||<b>CUTOFF x.xxx </b>|Sets the cutoff value defining an isosurface. Typically, smaller values correspond to a larger object. Cutoffs can be either positive or negative. In the case of a molecular orbital, a positive number indicates to use both positive and negative cutoffs. Adding an explicit "+" sign before the number indicates that only the positive part of the surface is desired.||<b>DEBUG</b>|Produces voluminous detail for program debugging.||<b>ECCENTRICITY <br />{cx cy cz f_ab}</b>|Sets the eccentricity of a sphere, ellipsoid, atomic orbital, or lobe. The first three numbers define the "principal" axis; the fourth parameter defines the ratio of the other two perpendicular axes to this main axis.||<b>FIXED/MODELBASED</b>|Sets whether the surface generated is to be associated with the fixed window -- and thus appear with all frames/models -- or is to be associated with the currently displayed model (the default).||<b>GRIDPOINTS</b>|Adds the specific gridpoints used by the "marching cubes" algorithm for the calculation of the isosurface. Primarily for discussion and debugging of the isosurface algorithm.||<b>IGNORE(atom_exp)</b>|Specifies a set of atoms to completely ignore when generating a solvent-related surface (<b>SOLVENT</b> or <b>SASURFACE</b>).

newCmd('','','*v-10.2;','There are several surface object types. These include: <br /><br />[||<b >ATOMICORBITAL <br />n l m Zeff</b >|The Schroedinger solution to the hydrogen atom wavefunction. The three quantum numbers n, l, and m, must be such that abs(m) &lt;= l &lt; n. For solutions with imaginary roots, the two m values simply designate the two real linear combinations of these imaginary solutions. The optional effective nuclear charge, Zeff, determines the overall size of the orbital (default is 6, carbon). Add the keyword PHASE for a two-color orbital, which can be colored using the COLOR keyword followed by two color names or values.  ||<b >ELLIPSOID <br />{{cx cy cz f_ab}}</b >|Draws an ellipsoid having a single unique axis. The first three numbers define the "principal" axis; the fourth parameter defines the eccentricity of the ellipsoid -- the ratio of the other two perpendicular axes to this main axis.||<b >FILE "filename" n</b >|Depict the n-th isosurface from the specified CUBE or {misc/JVXL-format.pdf~JVXL} file. Empty quotes indicate that the loaded file already has CUBE or JVXL data present, and that that data should be used for construction of the surface. The optional number "n" specifies which volume or surface should be used in the case of a CUBE file with multiple orbitals or a JVXL file with multiple surfaces. Thus, for example, <b >load test.cube.gz;isosurface FILE ""</b > will load the coordinates from the GZIPped cube file, then display its first isosurface. A default directory can be set using {#.set (misc)~set defaultDirectory}, and for applets a proxy server can be set for non-host file loading using {#.set (misc)~set appletProxy}. Units of Bohr are assumed unless the keyword ANGSTROMS precedes this parameter. The keyword "FILE" is not required.||<b >FUNCTIONXY <br />"functionName" <br />{{originXYZ}} <br />{{ni xi yi zi}}<br /> {{nj xj yj zj}}<br /> {{nk xk yk zk}} </b >|(applet only) The FUNCTIONXY keyword specifies that the Z-value at a given X,Y coordinate will be determined by a callback to a JavaScript function on the page containing the applet. In this case functionName(app, int_x, int_y) will be called. The parameters mirror the parameters in the header of a CUBE file. Units of Bohr are assumed unless the keyword ANGSTROMS precedes this parameter. Thus, we require an origin of the voxel space and for each nominal direction x, y, and z, the number of grid points and the direction of the unit vector along that edge. These four quantities must be in braces.||<b >LCAOCARTOON <br />"type" (atom_exp)</b >|Draws a lobe or p orbital (two lobes) centered at the FIRST atom of the specified expression. (Typically this would be an expression for a single, specific atom, such as <b >atomno=3</b >). See the {#.lcaoCartoon~lcaoCartoon} command for a discussion of the possible types of LCAO cartoons (as well as a simpler way to create them).||<b >LOBE <br />{{cx cy cz f_ab}}</b >|Draws a single tear-drop shaped object (an xy-compressed center lobe of a dz2 orbital) anywhere at any size in any direction with any amount of distortion. The first three numbers define the axis of the lobe; the fourth parameter defines its eccentricity  -- the ratio of the other two perpendicular axes to this main axis.||<b>MEP</b>|Depicts the molecular electrostatic potential, as calculated by SUM(q_i/r_i), where q_i is the partial charge on atom i (as found in the loaded model file) and r_i is the distance from atom i to a particular point in space. The molecular electrostatic potential is not typically displayed itself. Rather, it is usually mapped onto a molecular surface. For example: <b>isosurface resolution 6 SOLVENT map MEP</b> produces a smooth surface at the van der Waals distance around the molecule colored by the molecular electrostatic potential.||<b >MO n</b >|Denotes the n-th molecular orbital described in the file that is currently loaded. Adjusting the CUTOFF to suit the situation is recommended. Molecular orbitals are automatically bicolor; color them one specific color using COLOR and just one color name or value. RESOLUTION can be used to good effect to increase or decrease the precision of the rendering. <b >Note that only the atom-based orbitals for the currently selected atoms are utilized</b >. (Although, if no atoms are selected, all atomic orbitals are used in the calculation.) Thus, one can selectively see how atomic orbitals from each atom in the molecule are contributing to any given molecular orbital.||<b>PLANE "xy"<br />PLANE "xz"<br />PLANE "yz"</b>|Indicates that what is desired is not really an isosurface but rather one of three standard planar slices through the data set. Using COLOR ABSOLUTE, the range of mapped values can be changed. The range -0.008 0.008 is recommended for molecular orbitals. Note: In the case of PLANE, exactly one object must follow, and that object is then used to color the plane. Simply specifying a plane and no mapping data set produces no result.||<b>PLANE {{a b c d}}</b>|The four given values define the plane, as "ax + by + cz + d = 0". ||<b >SASURFACE radius</b >|Depicts the "solvent-accessible" surface based on the currently selected atom set. This surface is described by the <i >center</i > of the solvent probe as it rolls along the surface. It is larger than the "molecular" surface. The radius is optional.||<b >SOLVENT radius</b >|Depicts the "solvent-excluded" or "molecular" surface around the currently selected atoms (or the entire model if no atoms are selected). If only a subset of the atoms is selected, then only the corresponding subset of the molecular surface is depicted. This surface is defined as the surface formed by rolling a spherical solvent "probe" around the molecule at the distance of the van der Waals radii of the atoms.
