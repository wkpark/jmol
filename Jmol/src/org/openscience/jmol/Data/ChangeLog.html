    <ul>
      <li> Numerous small bug fixes. (DG) </li>
      <li> FileSaver, XYZSaver and CMLSaver classes are new.  You can now 
           save the current structure to either XYZ or CML formats. (DG 
           &amp; EW) </li>

      <li> Rewrite of file-I/O routines.  They all implement ChemFile now.
        (DG)</li> 
    </ul>

    <h3>jmol-0.4 (since jmol-0.3)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Jmol can now parse Chemical Markup Language (CML) files
        thanks to E.L. Willighagen (EW)</li>
      <li> Many internal changes in the AtomType JTable supporting

      <li> AtomTypeTable now stores the AtomType information as a
        resource (DG) </li>
      <li> Changes in AtomTypeTable headers to support multiple line
        headers (DG)</li>
      <li> StatusBar is now a 3-wide set of JLabels that post more
        useful information (DG & CS) </li>
      <li> Swing 1.1.1 Beta 2 (HTML labels if we want to use them) (DG) </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>jmol-0.3 (since jmol-0.2)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> PhysicalProperties (Charges, NMRShieldings, Vectors,
        etc.) can be set by the file readers.  Christoph Steinbeck 
        asked for this originally when he wrote GaussianFile.  It was 
        a good idea, and was worth the extensive rewrite.  (DG) </li>
      <li> Swing 1.1.1 Beta 1 (fixes some annoying bugs for Java 1.1 
        users) (DG) </li>
      <li> The GaussianFile class has been updated to read general 
        Gaussian files (not just G98) and to automatically compute 
        chemical shifts using stored <em>ab initio</em> values for 
        tetramethyl silane's chemical shift. (CS) </li>
      <li> Some bug fixes. (DG) </li>
      <li> Shaded bonds that look like cylinders.  Well, at least they look
        a little bit like cylinders. End caps would be a nice addition, but
        I've been a bit busy lately. (DG)</li>
      <li> FileTyper and ImageTyper accessories for JFileChooser make
        choosing file types more sensible than just using the filename
        filter.  These classes were rationalized after 0.2 had
        already been released.  They also listen to the JFileChooser
        to try to guess what kind of file you just selected (only
        if UseFileExtensions is set). (DG)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>jmol-0.2 (since jmol-0.1.1)</h3>
    <ul>

      <li>Many internal changes.</li>

      <li>Jmol has moved to a new home.  I've been working on a web
        site called "The OpenScience Project", and have registered a
        domain for it, so Jmol is the first of the software projects
        that is housed at www.openscience.org (DG) </li>

      <li> Christoph Steinbeck contributed a new input filter for
        Gaussian 98 log files, complete with a parser for NMR chemical
        shifts. (CS)</li>
      
      <li>The file readers now subclass a more general (but very
        simple) ChemFile class.  This should make addition of other file
        readers easier. (DG)</li>

      <li>File Type selection is no longer dependent on the file's
        extension.  You can select a "*.jnk" file and explicitly 
        tell Jmol what kind of file it is when opening the file. (DG)</li>

      <li>There is a strange interaction between fillPolygon in jdk1.2
        and the X server under Solaris x86.  (And circles under jdk1.2
        look lumpy on many architectures.)  I've built a workaround into
        Jmol which involves talking directly to the Graphics2D object
        underlying the display panel to set some Rendering hints.  This
        workaround has the benefit of making some <em>really</em> nice
        pictures when you want high quality (but lower speed).  If you
        have jdk1.2, turn on AntiAliasing in the Preferences to see the
        difference.  An unfortunate side effect is that you now need the
        jdk1.2 classes to compile (but not run) Jmol.  (DG)</li>

      <li>A Jpeg encoder has been added. The JpegEncoder and its
        associated classes are Copyright (c) 1998, James R. Weeks and
        BioElectroMech.  This software is based in part on the work of
        the Independent JPEG Group. (DG)</li>

      <li>Build process now uses a Makefile. (PENDING - DG) </li>
      
      <li>The Makefile now has the ability to create javadocs of 
        the source code. (HG) </li>

     </ul>

    <h3>jmol-0.1.1 (since jmol-0.1)</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Removed the extra double-buffering that resulted from not
        understanding that Swing components are automatically
        double-buffered. This resulted in substantial performance
        improvements. (DG)</li>

      <li>Fixed some depth strangeness in the drawn atom
        sizes. (DG)</li>
      
      <li>Fixed the bonds so that they render more realistically as
        the molecule is being rotated.  End caps for the bonds are
        still in progress. (DG)</li>

      <li>Reordered the toolbar buttons and added a button for
        molecule deformations that will eventually do something
        useful. (DG)</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>jmol-0.1 (since jmol-0.0.4)</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li>There are some major new features, so the minor version number 
        has been incremented. (DG)</li>
      
      <li>Atom Types are now editable using "Atom Properties" in the
        Edit Menu.  This added a large chunk of interface code to do the
        JTable and cell editors and column sorters.  The edited atom
        types are saved in the .jmol directory under the user's home
        directory. (DG - PENDING)</li>
      
      <li>The Preferences dialog now saves preference info in the 
        .jmol directory under the user's home directory. (DG)</li>
      
      <li>Reorganization of classes into a jar file. (DG) </li>

      <li>An atom selection mechanism now is working. (DG) </li>

      <li>Reorganization of source: BondTypeTable is gone, BondType is
        now replaced by Bond.  Many other changes for new
        AtomTypeTable. (DG) </li>

      <li>Silly little Splash screen, but it makes startup feel faster
        when there is something popped up on the screen almost
        immediately.</li>
      
      <li>There is now a "Front" item in the View menu.  The View 
        menu actions are not intuitive yet, so they will be changing 
        in a future version. Don't get used to them.(DG)</li>
      
      <li>There is a new "fast forward" button in the Animate dialog 
        that takes the animation to the last frame. (DG)</li>
      
      <li>The Rewind, FastForward, Next, and Previous buttons in the
        Animate dialog now stop the animation when they are pushed. 
        (DG)</li>

      <li>Swing version incremented to 1.1</li>
    
    </ul>
    
    <h3>jmol-0.0.4 (since jmol-0.0.3)</h3>
    
    <ul>

      <li>Now using swing-1.1beta3, with all of the associated package
        name changes from com.sun.java.swing to javax.swing (DG)</li>
      
      <li>Fixed bug in jmol.bat script (DG)</li>
      
      <li>"What's New" menu item in "Help" menu displays a dialog with
        the contents of this file (DG)</li>

      <li>"doc" subdirectory, empty for now, but it's the thought that
        counts (DG)</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>jmol-0.0.3 (since jmol-0.0.2)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Image encoders courtesy Jef Poskanzer were used to export
        GIF and PPM files (DG)</li>

      <li>New "Display" Menu with submenus for atoms, bonds, and
        labels (DG)</li>

      <li>New Icons courtesy Dean Jones were used whenever possible
        (DG)</li>

    </ul>
 
    <h3>jmol-0.0.2 (since jmol-0.0.1)</h3>
    <ul>

      <li>Atom Labels (DG)</li>

      <li>multi-frame XYZ file-reads (DG)</li>

      <li>Animation (DG)</li>

      <li>Preferences dialog (DG)</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>jmol-0.0.1 (first public release)</h3>
    <ul>

      <li>Everything (DG)</li>

      <li>Sensible polygon vertexes for QuickDraw Bonds (MB)</li>

      <li>single-frame XYZ file reads (DG)</li>

    </ul>
