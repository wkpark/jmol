In Jmol Instructions</span><br>
</div>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Description</span> - This tab is
designed to produce a web page template (no explanatory text) that
displays images of Jmol graphics, each of which can be converted to a
live Jmol display by the user.&nbsp; This makes initial loading of the
page faster.&nbsp; The image and initial Jmol setup for each occurence
can be chosen by setting up the Jmol viewer the way you wish.&nbsp; You
add the text later in your favorite web editor. An example picture of
such a page is shown below:<br>
<img style="border: 1px solid ; width: 250px; height: 268px;"
 alt="picture of a pop in web page" src="pop_in.png"><br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Instructions </span><br>
1) Set the relative path to the Jmol applet on you web site from where
you will put the folder (directory) containing the files created by
this program.&nbsp; Each "../" means step up one directory level.&nbsp;
Do not forget to account for the fact that the page produced by this
program is inside a folder (directory) that you will be adding to your
web site.&nbsp; Example: Jmol applet is in directory
/www/applets/java/jmol and your web site is in the directory
/www/yourname.&nbsp; You will be adding one more level for this page
(e.g. /www/yourname/thispage).&nbsp; The correct path to the Jmol
applet is ../../applets/java/jmol.<br>
2) Open the first file you want to appear in your page using the
File..Open.. menu in the Jmol viewer.<br>
3) Zoom, rotate, select, change colors, add orbitals, set the molecule
spinning or what ever you want to do.<br>
4) Set the size you want this displayed by adjusting the Pixels per
side of applet.<br>
5) Click on the "Add Present Jmol State as Instance" button.<br>
6) Repeat for as many different displays as you wish.&nbsp; Because of
the memory constraints of web browsers, it is probably best to limit
yourself to less than 6 different occurences of Jmol in one web
page.&nbsp; If they are very small you can do more.<br>
7) When done click on "Save .html as..".&nbsp; Provide a name without
an extension.&nbsp; This will be used for the directory in which all
the necessary files will be created.&nbsp; The .html file will be in
this directory, have the same name, but with the extension .html.<br>
8) Open the .html file in your favorite web editor and add you
explanatory text and anything else you wish.&nbsp; As long as you do
not alter the inside of the tables where Jmol will be displayed you
should be able to change the page without disrupting the JavaScript
that controls the behavior of Jmol.<br>
