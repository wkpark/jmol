    <section title="Jmol v10 Beta Testing">

      <p>
	Jmol v10 is a complete rewrite of most of Jmol.
	Major features/changes include:
	<ul>
	  <li>substantial performance improvements</li>
	  <li>true 3d graphics engine</li>
	  <li>support for macromolecule secondary structure graphics</li>
	  <li>additional script commands</li>
	  <li>support for the RasMol/Chime coordinate system orientation</li>
	  <li>JmolAppletControl buttons</li>
	</ul>
      </p>
      <p>
	Along with these new features comes a new set of bugs.
	Thank you for helping us test out new releases of Jmol and
	helping us find these bugs.
      </p>

      <p>
	<i>
	  At this point, we feel obligated to admit that this is not
	  really being conducted as a formal <strong>beta test.</strong>
	  During the test phase we are continuing to make substantial
	  changes to the code; changes that go far beyond a beta test.
	  But we are continuing to develop and enhance the code,
	  regardless of what we call it.

	<p>
	  If you can, please submit bugs directly into the bug tracking
	  database provided by sourceforge. This will save us a little
	  time and, most importantly, will ensure that your bugs do not
	  get lost.

	<p>
	During the test program, support will be provided through the
	<b>jmol-users@lists.sf.net</b> mailing list. If you are not on
	the list and would like to subscribe you can go to

      <section title="Release/distribution mechanism">
	<p>
	  Test releases will be made on this page. Releases will be a single
	  .zip file that contains test prerelease. You can unzip this file
	  using standard tools, including unzip, pkunzip, winzip, and jar.
	  We do not plan to release sample files or support code. For those
	  who are interested, source code is always available through
	  anonymous CVS checkout.

    <section title="Jmol10pre6">
      <p>
	Jmol version 10 pre-release 6 was released on 7 Mar 2004.
	This release includes
	the following enhancements:
	<ul>
	  <li>more fully populated popup menu</li>
	  <li>adoption of a proposed Jmol/Ghemical cpk coloring scheme</li>
	  <li>improved nucleotide set definitions</li>
	  <li>preliminary support for animations</li>
	  <li>preliminary support for unitcells</li>
	  <li>support for aromatic bonds in .mol files</li>
	  <li>support for color by charge</li>
	  <li>bug fixes</li>
	</ul>
	This release continues to have the
	following functional limitations:
	<ul>
	  <li>Macintosh popup menu gesture is incorrect</li>
	  <li>Only supports .xyz, .mol, and .pdb files</li>
	  <li>Does not have full animation support</li>
	  <li>Does not handle vibrations</li>
	  <li>Does not have full crystal cell support</li>
	  <li>
	    Will not automatically recognize protein secondary structures
	  </li>
	  <li>Will not render isosurfaces</li>
	  <li>Does not handle nucleotide graphic shapes</li>
	</ul>

	Unzip the code using the tool of your choice. It will unzip into
	a subdirectory of the current directory.
      </p>
      <p>
	The Java <b>jar</b> tool will work fine since a .jar is the same
	format as .zip : <b>jar xf Jmol10pre6.zip</b>
      </p>
      <p>
	To run the jmol application you can type: <b>java -jar Jmol.jar</b>
	<br/>With most GUIs, you also be able to double-click on Jmol.jar
	to launch it. (If this doesn't work then create an association
	for files with the extension .jar)
