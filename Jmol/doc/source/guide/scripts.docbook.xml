    <title>New Scripting Engine</title>
    <para>
      The scripting engine has been completely rewritten for Jmol Release
      6. As of this writing it should be considered *alpha test* code. Please
      supply feedback in case of bugs and/or unexpected behavior and/or
      with feature requests. You can do this through the jmol home page
      <ulink url="http://jmol.sourceforge.net">jmol.sourceforge.net</ulink>

  Jmol supports the RasMol scripting language defined by RasMol. 
  Information about RasMol can be found at 
  <ulink url="http://www.openrasmol.org/">www.openrasmol.org</ulink>
  The current URL for full RasMol documentation is:

  The Chime web browser plug-in was based upon the RasMol source code.
  Various extensions were added, including additional scripting
  commands. Information about Chime can be found at
  <ulink url="http://www.mdlchime.com/">www.mdlchime.com</ulink>
  The current URL for extended chime scripting commands is:
  <ulink url="http://www.mdlchime.com/chime/chimerasmol.html">

</para>
<para>
  Jmol currently supports many of the RasMol/Chime scripting commands. Our
  goal is to eventually provide full script support. This will provide
  a migration path for those who wish to move to an open source solution
  that supports a larger number of file formats on a wider variety of
  hardware platforms.

  Please give us feedback on what features you use and that are currently
  no implemented. This will help us prioritize future development.
