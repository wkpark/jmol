// CHANGES to 'visible.java' - module to predict colour of visible spectrum
// created July 2008 based on concept published by Darren L. Williams
// in J. Chem. Educ., 84(11), 1873-1877, 2007
//
// Judd-Vos-modified 1931 CIE 2-deg color matching functions (1978)
// The CIE standard observer functions were curve fitted using FitYK
// and the equations used for these calculations. The values obtained
// do not seem to vary appreciably from those published in the JChemEd article
