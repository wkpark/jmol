SHOW <formula> (create a molecule model from
                      its 'formula')
      SHOW <acceptor> <donor-1> <donor-2>...\n"
                     (create supramolecular model from\n"
                      radical 'acceptor' and ligand\n"
                      'donor-i' formulas)\n"
      
      The chemical 'formula' is a valid Lewis-type"
      line formula, similar to textbook examples."
      Use colons to denote multiple bonds (C::O double"
      bond, C:::N triple bond, etc.) and parentheses"
      to identify repeat units or side groups."
      Atomic symbols in the range H-Cf (Z = 1-98)"
      and repetition numbers 1-9 are allowed."
      Chemical formula symbols are case-sensitive.\n"
      
      Ligated free radicals (with free-valent acceptor"
      sites) can also be formed in specified hapticity"
      motifs with chosen molecular ligands. Radical"
      <acceptor> and ligand <donor-i> monomers are"
      specified by valid line formulas, with each"
      ligand <donor> formula preceded by a number of"
      colons (:) representing the number of 2e sites"
      in the desired ligand denticity (such as ':NH3'"
      for monodentate ammine ligand, '::NH2CH::CH2'"
      for bidentate vinylamine ligand, or ':::Bz' for"
      tridentate benzene ligand). Each such ligation"
      symbol may be prefixed with a stoichiometric"
      coefficient 2-9 for the number of ligands.\n"
      
      In both molecular and supramolecular formulas,"
      valid transition metal duodectet structures"
      are also accepted. For d-block molecular species,"
      the default idealized metal hybridization isomer"
      can be altered with the REBOND command."
      For d-block species one can also include"
      coordinative ligands (:Lig), enclosed in"
      parentheses and preceded by a colon symbol."
      Formal 'ylidic' charges are allowed only for"
      adjacent atom pairs (e.g., dative pi-bonds).\n"
      
      Models may also be specified by using acronyms"
      from a library of pre-formed species (many"
      at B3LYP/6-31+G* optimized level). Each such"
      acronym can also be used as a monovalent ligand"
      in MUTATE commands, as illustrated below.\n"
