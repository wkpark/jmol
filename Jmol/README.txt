Jmol

Jmol is an open-source molecule viewer and editor written in Java. Jmol
provides a platform-independent means of viewing 3D molecular models
produced by various software packages (ACES II, ADF, GAMESS, PC GAMESS,
Gaussian 9x, XYZ, PDB, and CML). Molecular models can be translated and
rotated. Geometric properties can be calculated, such as bond lengths,
bond angles, or torsions. Multi-step files and files with frequency
information can be animated. The molecules displayed can printed or
exported in several graphics formats (JPG, GIF, PPM).

Jmol was developed through a voluntary collaboration of researchers
around the world. For more information, please visit the Jmol Web site
at http://jmol.sourceforge.net/.

Installation:

  If you have downloaded the source distribution, e.g. jmol-6.source.zip,
  then Jmol needs to be compiled first. For this you need an Ant
  installation (ant.apache.org).

  Then, on both Unix and Windows, you can compile Jmol with:

    ant jar

Running Jmol:

  On Unix, run the jmol script found in the distribution's main
  directory.

  On Windows, run the jmol.bat batch script found in the distribution's
  main directory. Alternatively, from any Windows Explorer, you can 
  double click on the jmol.jar.

  On all platforms this should also work:

    java -jar jmol.jar

  For information about building Jmol from the source, please read the
  Jmol Developers Guide in doc/.
