/*
 
 * The JVXL file format
 * --------------------
 * 
 * as of 3/29/07 this code is COMPLETELY untested. It was hacked out of the
 * Jmol code, so there is probably more here than is needed.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * see http://www.stolaf.edu/academics/chemapps/jmol/docs/misc/JVXL-format.pdf
 *
 * The JVXL (Jmol VoXeL format) is a file format specifically designed
 * to encode an isosurface or planar slice through a set of 3D scalar values
 * in lieu of a that set. A JVXL file can contain coordinates, and in fact
 * it must contain at least one coordinate, but additional coordinates are
 * optional. The file can contain any finite number of encoded surfaces. 
 * However, the compression of 300-500:1 is based on the reduction of the 
 * data to a SINGLE surface. 
 * 
 * This is a first attempt at a generic JVXL file reader and writer class.
 * It is an extraction of Jmol org.jmol.viewer.Isosurface.Java and related pieces.
 * 
 * The original Marching Cubes code was written by Miguel Howard in 2005.
 * The classes Parser, ArrayUtil, and TextFormat are condensed versions
 * of the classes found in org.jmol.util
 * 
 * All code relating to JVXL format is copyrighted 2006/2007 and invented by 
 * Robert M. Hanson, 
 * Professor of Chemistry, 
 * St. Olaf College, 
 * 1520 St. Olaf Ave.
 * Northfield, MN. 55057.
 * 
 * Implementations of the JVXL format should reference 
 * "Robert M. Hanson, St. Olaf College" and the opensource Jmol project.
 * 
 * 
 * implementing marching squares; see 
 * http://www.secam.ex.ac.uk/teaching/ug/studyres/COM3404/COM3404-2006-Lecture15.pdf
 * 
 * lines through coordinates are identical to CUBE files
 * after that, we have a line that starts with a negative number to indicate this
 * is a JVXL file:
 * 
 * line1:  (int)-nSurfaces  (int)edgeFractionBase (int)edgeFractionRange  
 * (nSurface lines): (float)cutoff (int)nBytesData (int)nBytesFractions
 * 
 * definition1
 * edgedata1
 * fractions1
 * colordata1
 * ....
 * definition2
 * edgedata2
 * fractions2
 * colordata2
 * ....
 * 
 * definitions: a line with detail about what sort of compression follows
 * 
 * edgedata: a list of the count of vertices ouside and inside the cutoff, whatever
 * that may be, ordered by nested for loops for(x){for(y){for(z)}}}.
 * 
 * nOutside nInside nOutside nInside...
 * 
 * fractions: an ascii list of characters represting the fraction of distance each
 * encountered surface point is along each voxel cube edge found to straddle the 
 * surface. The order written is dictated by the reader algorithm and is not trivial
 * to describe. Each ascii character is constructed by taking a base character and 
 * adding onto it the fraction times a range. This gives a character that can be
 * quoted EXCEPT for backslash, which MAY be substituted for by '!'. Jmol uses the 
 * range # - | (35 - 124), reserving ! and } for special meanings.
 * 
 * colordata: same deal here, but with possibility of "double precision" using two bytes.
